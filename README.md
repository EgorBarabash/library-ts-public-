This is my project where I learned how to work with the backend and database (firebase). The main task was to get books from the computer and upload them already parsed to the database. Then I get them on the frontend and with the help of react I served them in the required form. I also added several different filters. From categories by genre to the most popular. I also made registration and each registered user could customize their profile and choose their favorite books. (maybe it doesn't work because I haven't made any changes for over a year and then I was just learning. The code is also not super but it worked as it should)  ðŸ™‚
